# Unity3D_DualShock4_Support
Support DualShock4 when native new InputSystem Unity3D

Attention, because unity3d have bugs with send data for not USB HID, is not fully support bluetooth mode and send data, if future Unity Team fix this bug, this code been work i hope.

i dont know why unity not use "HidD_SetOutputReport"(in windows, how did in linux idk) for send data not for USB devices and i hope they fix that
